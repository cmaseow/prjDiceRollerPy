Written in Python 3.7.0; "Dice Roller" Challenge from reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8s0cy1/20180618_challenge_364_easy_create_a_dice_roller/

Description: 

I love playing D&D with my friends, and my favorite part is creating character
sheets (my DM is notorious for killing us all off by level 3 or so). One major part of making 
character sheets is rolling the character's stats. Sadly, I have lost all my dice, so I'm asking 
for your help to make a dice roller for me to use!

The first number is the number of dice to roll, the d just means "dice", it's just used to split 
up the two numbers, and the second number is how many sides the dice have. So the above example of "3d6" 
means "roll 3 6-sided dice". Also, just in case you didn't know, in D&D, not all the dice we roll are the 
normal cubes. A d6 is a cube, because it's a 6-sided die, but a d20 has twenty sides, so it looks a lot closer to a ball than a cube.
The first number, the number of dice to roll, can be any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
The second number, the number of sides of the dice, can be any integer between 2 and 100, inclusive.
